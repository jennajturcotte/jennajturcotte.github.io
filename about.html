                        <br><p>Raised in the small town of Petawawa, Ontario, I always had trouble defining myself as an artist. From the age of six I grew to love drawing and writing. As I got older I became interested in the idea of website designing and creating graphics, but I wasn't sure where to start my designing venture. The first time I really had the chance to take a stab at designing was in my grade ten media-arts class, which taught me the basics in Photoshop. In grade twelve my best friend had me join Yearbook which is when I really got my chance to shine. I—along with about ten other girls—was given the opportunity to take pictures of every major school event that happened throughout the year, as well as actually come up with a theme and design the school's 2015 yearbook. This opened my eyes to the many possibilities that design and photography had to offer.</p>
​
<p>However, I originally had planned on being an addictions counsellor after high school. But that plan changed quickly after my first semester of grade twelve ended. I then proceeded to take a year off to figure out what I wanted to do. I had always been creative since I was a young child, so I decided to take a look at the different art and design programs that the many Ontario colleges had to offer. I came across the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College in Ottawa and immediately found it to be a perfect fit for me. With so many different career options and skills to learn, I had to apply right away.</p>

<p>Since then, I have improved my skills with Photoshop, learned how to use Illustrator and Lightroom (along with many other Adobe applications), and finally learned how to use a DSLR camera on manual.</p>

<p>But what I was most excited for was learning how to properly film video. Although I have much to learn in the videography industry, I still had lots of fun with my class assignments. I even had the chance to film a promotional video for a friend of mine who is an up-and-coming Ottawa music producer. I was really proud of the result, and my friend was incredibly happy with the video when I sent it back to him.</p>

<p>I love trying new things and acquiring new skills, so my hope is to learn as many new skills as possible throughout the remainder of the program and take on as many new opportunities as I can.</p>
